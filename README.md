Project Overview: Sorting Algorithm Implementation

Description:
This project showcases a sorting algorithm implementation using Java. The primary focus is on the bubble sort algorithm, which efficiently organizes elements in an ArrayList.

Key Features:

Bubble Sort Algorithm: The project includes a robust implementation of the bubble sort algorithm. This algorithm systematically sorts elements within an ArrayList based on their comparable values.

Utilizations:

Sorting Data: The core functionality revolves around sorting an ArrayList of integers. The implemented bubble sort algorithm rearranges elements, ensuring a well-organized and ascending order.

Technologies Used:

Java Programming Language: The project leverages Java for its versatility and efficiency in handling data structures.
Random Number Generation: Utilizes Java's Random class to populate an ArrayList with random integers.
ArrayList Data Structure: Implements Java's ArrayList to store and manage an ordered collection of integers.

Sample Code:

sort.java: Contains the sorting logic, including a generic swap function and the implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.
app.java: The main application file that generates a random ArrayList, prints the original list, applies the bubble sort, and prints the sorted result.

Usage:

Clone the project.
Compile and run the App.java file to observe the sorting algorithm in action.
This project serves as a practical example of algorithmic implementation, providing a foundation for understanding and applying sorting techniques in Java.
